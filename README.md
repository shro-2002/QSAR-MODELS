# QSAR-MODELS

This repository contains the code and data files for a machine learning project that analyzes two datasets: QSAR Androgen and QSAR Toxicity. The project aims to predict the biological activity of compounds based on their molecular descriptors using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB) algorithms.
